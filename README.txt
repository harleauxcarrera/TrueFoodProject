REPLY: Aye where ma nigh at doe?

UPDATE FROM ERICK DEE: 

Aye my niga so here is what currently works with my xampp database:
	-Login UI (EXCEPT THE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK, WELL DO LAST OR DELETE IT since I could 	not get it last time unless u wanna try)
	-RECIPES UI (FULLY WORKING FUNCTION WISE JUST NEED TO MAKE IT LOOK PURTY)
		* See all it's classes it's wired to so u can see how it works (RecipeVC 	and RecipeTableViewCell)
	-CALENDAR UI (FUNCTIONALLY WORKING, but not updating UI with the data it fetches 	from the xampp database)

That's what is working so far because those are the databases that I Know u have on the web version of trufuud, I Haven't made the rest of the db tables on my xampp to retrieve data from cause I don't know what they are.

Also let me know if u have questions and if u want me to setup the xampp on ur comp .. we can either meet or I can do it remotely with ur help online, that way you can demo what I have so far or we can meet for that too.
